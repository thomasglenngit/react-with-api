# **REQUIREMENTS**

# **SETUP**

# **TECHNOLOGIES USED**

_[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)_

<br>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## NYTimesAPI Reference

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**


# **INSTALL**

## **INSTALLING WITH NODE**


with the root project folder open in your code editor, execute the following in your terminal:

``cd ProjectName``

``npm install``

``npm run build``
